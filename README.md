# Math algorithms

## Description

This repository contains a collection of math algorithms written in C, with the purpose of improving my programming skills.

## Usage
    
To use any of the algorithms, simply download the corresponding file (`.c` or `.java`) and compile it with your favorite compiler. Most of the algorithms are written in C, so you can compile them with `gcc` or `clang`, for example. Some algorithms are written in Java, which can be compiled with `javac`.
